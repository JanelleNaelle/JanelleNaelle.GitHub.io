<p class="Titre"><h1>This is <em>still</em> a Motherfucking website.</h1></p>	
  <P>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.
  <H1>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</H1>
  <h2><STRONG>7 fucking declarations.</p></STRONG></h2>

<p>That's how much <img src="CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png" title="CSS" height="25"> it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <em>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</P>
<ul>
	<li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
	<li><EM>Still</EM> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
	<li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
	<li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
	<li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
</ul>
 <h2><p>And guess what, motherfucker:</p></H2>
 <P>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</P>

<h1>Let it breathe</h1>
<p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>

<P>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</P>

<h1>A little less contrast</h1>
Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.

<h1>Size Matters</h1>
I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.

<h1>Line-width, motherfucker</h1>
Looking at an <img src="https://cdn.freebiesupply.com/logos/large/2x/lcd-logo-png-transparent.png" title="LCD" height="25">LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.

<h2>Yes,this is <em>also</em> fucking satire, you fuck</h2>
<p>I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
